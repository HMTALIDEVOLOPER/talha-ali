            Fast Food Benefits
            <br>
        <dd>1. Convenience and Time-Saving
            Quick meals: Fast food is designed for people on the go. Itâ€™s convenient when you're busy, traveling, or
            need a quick meal.
            <br>
            Availability: Fast food restaurants are often open late or even 24/7, making it an easy option when other
            dining places are closed.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Cost-Effective
            Affordable options: Many fast food chains offer budget-friendly meals, which can be helpful when you're
            looking for a cheap meal.
            <br>
            Value menus: Chains often have "value" or "combo" meals that give you more food for less money.
